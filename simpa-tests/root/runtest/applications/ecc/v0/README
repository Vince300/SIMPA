for tested compiler, there are some modification
1. the simpa.hit.main function is midified to encode();decode(); need not user interactive.
2. get data from stdin ---> get data from array
3. put data to stdout  ---> if _GENREF, put the data to data.h 
else compare the result with expected result( a array in data.h), if success, printf PASSED, else FAILED.
4. because in m568c char is 16bit, unsigned char -8 !=248, add some code to convert it.

there are some other modification for different input , using conditional compiler option _GENREF. if you want to modify the input data, you can do:
1. delete initialization of ENCODE[] and DECODE[] from data.h
2. modify the initialization of INPUT[] and the definition of NUMBER(the number of INPUT members)	
3. use native compiler to compile this project with _GENREF and run it to generate ENCODE[] and DECODE[].
4. now , use it to test tested compiler, compile this project without _GENREF.
