# DEFINITIONS:
# Master scripts accept the '-l <level>' option
# level==skip    means that the test is not run,
# level==compile means that one only checks for the compilation,
# level==light   means - for functional tests that the correctness of results is checked
#                        using a reduced set of inputs (one or few files in the "inputs"
#                        subdirectory for example),
# level==full    means - for functional tests that the correctness of results is checked
#                        using every input available,

# GRAMMAR OF CONTENT:
# <Path to the run_all>  <options>
# the options sets are surrounded by parenthesis and separated by commas.
# blanks (spaces and tabs) are separators
#
# options are set of parameters given to the shell ccsc100,
# (opt1 (opt2, opt3)) means (opt1 opt2, opt1 opt3)
# remark: if opt2=="" then (opt1 (opt2, opt3)) means (opt1, opt1 opt3)
