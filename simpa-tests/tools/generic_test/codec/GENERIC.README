To adapt this test generic directory, the only parts to modify are:

        * the "OPTIONS" part at the beginning of the run_all_params.pm file,

        * the file Makefile.scc so that it finds the targets and the objects files,

        * the files files_in_out_ref.txt files_in_out_ref_light.txt to describe the inputs/outputs/ref files of the targets and the command line,

	* the file ../inputs/files.infos to describe the properties of the input files (or _QA_PERF_<target> in performance mode).

The targets in the files_in_out_ref{,_light}.txt must correspond to those in run_all.pl and those in Makefile.scc

Good tests
